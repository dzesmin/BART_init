Order of execution.
In the BART_init directory do the following:

1.
edit makeP.py - input desired range of pressure in wrapper 
run makeP.py as makeP.py
the pressure file will be placed in inputs/press_file/

2. 
edit makeAbund.py - input desired metalicity
run makeAbun.py as makeAbun.py
the abundance file will be placed in inputs/abundances/

3.
choose a tep file and place it in the TEA/inputs/tepfile/

4.
edit BARTconfig.py - input names and locations of the BART files
                     and names of the input and output species
                     as readJANAF.py produces them

5.
run makeatm.py
the pre_atm file will be places in TEA/inputs/pre_atm/
this will also run initialPT profile and return free parameters

6.
change the directory to TEA
cd TEA/

7.
copy BARTconfig.py into the TEA root directory
cp ~/BART_init/BARTconfig.py /BART_init/TEA/BARTconfig.py

8.
run prepipe to produce thermochemical library
prepipe.py

9. 
run TEA
this will produce final atm_file which will be placed in TEA/results/

10.
go back to BART_init directory
cd ..

11.
run function readatm() inside InputConverter.py
this will return temperature, abundance array and other important info
needed for Transit
